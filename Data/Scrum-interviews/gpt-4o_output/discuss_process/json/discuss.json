My background in project management informs my structured approach to studying economic factors, while my academic pursuit deepens my understanding of geographical influences. I hold the epistemological assumption that knowledge is constructed through spatial and economic interactions. This assumption potentially biases my interpretation towards emphasizing systemic patterns over individual actions. My positionality shapes my research by encouraging a multidisciplinary approach that bridges geography and economics, ensuring that my findings are both contextually grounded and practically applicable. This reflection facilitates a balanced framework, aligning my scholarly work with my professional and personal insights.",
